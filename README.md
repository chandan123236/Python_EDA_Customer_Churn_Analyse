# Python_EDA_Customer_Churn_Analyse

Summary and Recommendations
Objective

The analysis investigates key factors contributing to customer churn, with a primary focus on contract types, payment methods, service subscriptions, internet service types, and customer tenure. The goal is to identify high-risk segments and recommend actionable strategies to improve customer retention.

📈 Key Insights
Contract Type

Customers on month-to-month contracts experience the highest churn rate (42%), significantly higher than those on one-year (11%) and two-year contracts (3%).

Insight: Long-term contracts substantially improve retention and strengthen customer commitment.

Payment Methods

Customers paying via electronic checks have the highest churn rate (45%), compared to 15–18% among users paying with credit cards, bank transfers, or mailed checks.

Insight: Electronic payment users may face trust, convenience, or fee concerns; encouraging alternative payment methods could reduce churn.

Tenure

Customers with less than one year of tenure churn at nearly 50%, compared to 35% for 1–3 years, and only 15% for more than three years.

Insight: The first year is critical; onboarding and engagement programs are essential to retention success.

Internet Service Type

Fiber-optic users churn at 30%, higher than DSL users at 20%.

Insight: Dissatisfaction with pricing, competition, or service quality may contribute to churn; quality improvements or targeted support programs may help.

Senior Citizens

Senior citizens demonstrate a 41% churn rate, significantly higher than the 26% churn rate among non-senior customers.

Insight: Personalized support and specialized plans may significantly improve retention.

📊 Visual Insights

Bar charts and stacked percentage plots clearly reveal the contrast in churn distribution across payment methods, contract types, and tenure groups.

Line and comparative graphs show a strong decline in churn with increasing tenure, reinforcing the importance of early engagement.

Service-based visualizations highlight that customers without support services like Tech Support, Online Security, and Backup plans churn at disproportionately high rates.

📝 Recommendations

Promote Long-Term Contracts: Offer loyalty discounts, bundle pricing, or reward programs to shift customers from monthly plans to annual contracts.

Encourage Secure Payment Methods: Educate customers on safer, more stable payment options and consider incentive-based transitions away from electronic checks.

Strengthen Early-Stage Engagement: Leverage onboarding campaigns, personalized offers, and proactive support during the first year.

Target Senior Customers: Implement dedicated care programs, simplified service plans, and direct assistance channels to reduce churn.

Improve Service Experience for Fiber Users: Investigate service quality concerns and competitive benchmarking to design tailored improvement plans.

📌 Conclusion

The analysis clearly demonstrates that churn is heavily influenced by contract structure, payment behavior, service adoption, and tenure duration. Prioritizing customer experience during the early months, promoting long-term commitment, and reducing friction in payment and support services can substantially increase retention and lifetime customer value.
